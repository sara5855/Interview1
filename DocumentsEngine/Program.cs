        ///         1.4. write unit tests + mocks to MemoryStorage
        ///     2. Implement StartMakingDiscounts in DocumentsDiscountService. This service responsible for making discounts to all documents every x seconds.
        ///     3. When your service starts, call the StartMakingDiscounts so it will continue making dicounts as long as your whole service lives
